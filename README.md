## Sample Security Lab Ansible Playbook

This playbook installs and configures the ELK stack, Kali Linux, DVWA, mod_security, and forwards DVWA logs to the ELK stack using Filebeat. It also starts the Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Filebeat services and enables them to start automatically on boot.
You will need to modify the code to fit your specific needs and environment. For example, you may need to adjust the Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash versions, and you will need to provide the templates for the Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, mod_security, and Filebeat configuration files. You may also need to change the Apache log file path if it is different on your system.

## Advanced XSS Scanner 
This script will crawl the website, following links and forms, and perform a variety of tests using different payloads to look for XSS vulnerabilities. It will then print the vulnerabilities that it finds, including the URL, parameter, and payload that was used to exploit the vulnerability.

You can customize and expand this script to meet your specific needs and requirements. For example, you can add more payloads and tests, handle different types of responses and HTTP methods, generate reports, and integrate the scanner into your existing workflow.
