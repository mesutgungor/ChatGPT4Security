## Sample Security Lab Ansible Playbook

This playbook installs and configures the ELK stack, Kali Linux, DVWA, mod_security, and forwards DVWA logs to the ELK stack using Filebeat. It also starts the Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Filebeat services and enables them to start automatically on boot.
You will need to modify the code to fit your specific needs and environment. For example, you may need to adjust the Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash versions, and you will need to provide the templates for the Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, mod_security, and Filebeat configuration files. You may also need to change the Apache log file path if it is different on your system.

## Horizantal auto scaling kubernetes cluster for elk stack 
This manifest creates a service for Elasticsearch, a horizontal pod autoscaler for Elasticsearch, a stateful set of 3 Elasticsearch replicas, a persistent volume claim for the Elasticsearch data, a service for Kibana, a horizontal pod autoscaler for Kibana, a deployment of 3 Kibana replicas, a service for Logstash, a horizontal pod autoscaler for Logstash, and a deployment of 3 Logstash replicas. It also configures the Elasticsearch environment variables and the Logstash input and output settings.

You will need to modify the code to fit your specific needs and environment. For example, you may need to adjust the Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash versions,

## Advanced XSS Scanner 
This script will crawl the website, following links and forms, and perform a variety of tests using different payloads to look for XSS vulnerabilities. It will then print the vulnerabilities that it finds, including the URL, parameter, and payload that was used to exploit the vulnerability.

You can customize and expand this script to meet your specific needs and requirements. For example, you can add more payloads and tests, handle different types of responses and HTTP methods, generate reports, and integrate the scanner into your existing workflow.

## Python SAST and Defectdojo 

ChatGPT Input : write python script that scan a sample gitlab project with sast sca scanner and outputs results to defect dojo


This script will clone the sample GitLab project, scan it with a specified SAST SCA scanner, parse the output, and create a product, engagement, test, and finding in DefectDojo. It will then print the finding that was created in DefectDojo.

You can customize and expand this script to meet your specific needs and requirements. For example, you can add more scanners, options, and output formats, handle different types of responses and errors, generate reports, and integrate the scanner into your existing workflow.

## SigmaRule for Ransomeware
This rule uses the file_name and process_name fields to match specific strings that are commonly associated with ransomeware samples. If a match is found, the rule triggers an alert and includes information about the process and file names, paths, and user details in the alert. The rule also tags the alert with the attack.ransomware tag for easy identification and filtering.

You can customize and expand this rule to meet your specific needs and requirements. For example, you can add more strings and patterns, use different fields and operators, set different thresholds and conditions, and add more tags and outputs. You can also use this rule as a starting point and build more advanced and sophisticated rules that can detect ransomeware samples and other threats based on different indicators and behaviors.
