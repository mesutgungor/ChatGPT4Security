OWASP TOP 10, a list so grand,
Of the most common threats at hand,
From injection to cross-site scripting,
To broken authentication,

With these ten vulnerabilities,
Cyber attackers can cause great calamities,
But fear not, for with the right tools and knowledge,
We can prevent such attacks and halt their college.

Injection, the first on the list,
Can allow attackers to access your data and persist,
Broken authentication, the second in line,
Can give hackers access to your accounts and make you decline.

Cross-site scripting, the third on the list,
Can be used to steal your sensitive information and twist,
Broken access controls, the fourth in the game,
Can allow attackers to bypass your security and gain.

Security misconfiguration, the fifth on the list,
Can be exploited by attackers to gain access to your system and twist,
Insecure cryptography, the sixth on the list,
Can be used by hackers to decrypt your data and persist.

Insufficient logging and monitoring, the seventh on the list,
Can make it hard to detect and respond to attacks and persist,
Cross-site request forgery, the eighth on the list,
Can be used to trick users into performing unwanted actions and persist.

Using components with known vulnerabilities, the ninth on the list,
Can make your system vulnerable to attacks and persist,
And last but not least, the tenth on the list,
Is the insufficient security for APIs, which can be exploited by attackers and persist.

But with the OWASP TOP 10 by our side,
We can stay vigilant and protect our systems and pride,
For knowledge is power, and with it we can defend,
Against the threats and vulnerabilities that seek to harm and bend.
